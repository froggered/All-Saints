As we begin a new year, we give thanks for the growth of our community and look forward to welcoming new catechumens. This month we reflect on the Feast of Theophany and the blessing of waters that sanctifies all creation.

We are grateful for all who have joined us in worship over the Christmas season and look forward to a blessed year ahead.
