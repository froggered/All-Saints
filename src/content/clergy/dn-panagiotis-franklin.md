Raised Pentecostal, Dn. Panagiotis was received into the Orthodox Church aged 21 after deciding that church history and dogma indicated that he should be Orthodox. He came to find out that Jesus, a more appropriate form of worship, and a full spiritual life would have been even better reasons.

After graduating from an Evangelical theological school with a BA in Theology in 2022, he joined the Brotherhood of St Peter and St Paul. After two months Archimandrite Philip sent him to the St John of Damascus Institute of Theology in Balamand, Lebanon, where he studied Orthodox theology and stayed in Antiochian monasteries for ten months.

On 23rd February 2025 he was ordained deacon by the hand of Metropolitan Silouan. He now serves at the Brotherhood chapel and with Archimandrite Philip at All Saints of Lincolnshire.
