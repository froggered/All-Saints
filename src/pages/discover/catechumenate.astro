        <p class="text-charcoal text-lg mb-4">
          A catechumen is someone who is preparing to enter the Orthodox Church. The word
          comes from the Greek meaning "one who is being instructed." The catechumenate
          is a period of learning, prayer, and gradual incorporation into the life of the Church.
        </p>
        <p class="text-charcoal">
          At All Saints, most of our catechumens have never attended a church before.
          We welcome seekers from all backgrounds and meet you where you are in your
          spiritual journey.

              <p class="text-charcoal">
                The journey begins with questions. Attend services, meet with Fr. Philip,
                read, and explore. There's no commitment at this stage—just honest seeking.

              <p class="text-charcoal">
                When you're ready to commit to formal preparation, you'll be enrolled as
                a catechumen. This involves regular attendance at services, catechism classes,
                and growing participation in the life of the parish.

              <p class="text-charcoal">
                Through catechism classes and E-Quip sessions, you'll learn about Orthodox
                doctrine, worship, prayer, the saints, and how to live the Christian life.
                This is a time of transformation, not just information.

              <p class="text-charcoal">
                When the time is right—determined in consultation with Fr. Philip—you'll
                be received into the Church through Baptism and Chrismation (or through
                Chrismation alone if previously baptized in the name of the Trinity).

          <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
            There's no fixed timeline. The catechumenate typically lasts at least a year,
            but the duration depends on your individual journey. The goal is not to rush,
            but to be truly prepared to live as an Orthodox Christian.

            Regular attendance at services (especially Sunday Liturgy), participation in
            catechism classes, reading and study, and growing in prayer. You'll be
            supported by Fr. Philip and the whole parish community.
