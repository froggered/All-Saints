          Orthodox Christianity is the ancient faith passed down from Christ through His Apostles,
          preserved unchanged for two thousand years. If you're exploring Orthodoxy—whether from
          another Christian tradition or with no church background at all—you're welcome here.
        </p>
        <p class="text-charcoal">
          At All Saints of Lincolnshire, we've welcomed many seekers, and most of our catechumens
          had never attended a church before. We understand the questions you might have.

            When Philip told Nathanael about Jesus, Nathanael was skeptical. Philip's response
            was simple: "Come and see" (John 1:46). This remains the best way to discover Orthodoxy.
