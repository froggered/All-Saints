        <p class="text-charcoal text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          We're glad you're considering a visit to All Saints. Orthodox worship may be
          different from what you've experienced before, but don't worry—everyone is
          welcome, and there's no pressure to do anything you're not comfortable with.

              <h3 class="font-heading text-lg uppercase tracking-wide text-navy mb-3">What to Wear</h3>
              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                Modest, respectful attire is appropriate. There's no strict dress code—some
                people dress formally, others more casually. Come as you are.
              </p>

              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                Try to arrive a few minutes early. The Divine Liturgy begins at 10:00 AM on
                Sundays. It's fine if you're a bit late—just enter quietly.

              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                Nothing is required. Service books are available. You may wish to bring a
                head covering if you're a woman, though it's not required.

              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                Children are welcome at all services. Orthodox churches expect children to
                be present—don't worry if they make some noise.

              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                Orthodox Christians traditionally stand for worship. Seating is available
                for those who need it. Feel free to sit when you need to—no one will mind.

              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                You'll see people making the sign of the cross and bowing. As a visitor,
                you're not expected to do this—simply observe and participate as you feel
                comfortable.

              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                You may see people venerating (kissing) icons and lighting candles. These
                are expressions of devotion, not worship of the images themselves.
              </p>

              <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
                Holy Communion is reserved for baptized and chrismated Orthodox Christians
                who have prepared through fasting and confession. At the end of the service,
                everyone is welcome to receive blessed bread (antidoron).

          <p class="text-charcoal mb-4">
            After the Liturgy, we gather for breakfast—a cherished tradition where
            members of the congregation bring food to share. This is when everyone
            breaks their communion fast together, so it's a busy, social time with
            plenty of food, tea, and coffee. Please stay and join us! We'd love to
            meet you and answer any questions.
          </p>

            Fr. Philip is always happy to speak with visitors. Don't be shy about
            approaching him or anyone else in the parish.
