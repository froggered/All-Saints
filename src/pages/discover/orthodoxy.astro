        <p class="text-charcoal text-lg mb-4">
          Orthodox Christianity is the original Christian Church—the faith established
          by Jesus Christ and passed down through His Apostles. For over two thousand
          years, the Orthodox Church has preserved this faith unchanged, maintaining
          the fullness of Christian doctrine, worship, and spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-charcoal mb-4">
          The word "Orthodox" means "right belief" or "right worship." The Orthodox
          Church is not a denomination that broke away from something else—it is the
          continuous, unbroken community founded by Christ Himself.

          <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
            Orthodoxy holds to Holy Tradition—the Scriptures, the teachings of the Church
            Fathers, the decisions of the Ecumenical Councils, the liturgical life, and
            the lived experience of the saints. This living tradition has been faithfully
            transmitted from generation to generation.

          <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
            The Bible is central to Orthodox faith and worship. Scripture is read at every
            service, and the Church's interpretation of the Bible is guided by the same
            Holy Spirit who inspired its writing.

          <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
            The Orthodox Church celebrates the Holy Mysteries (Sacraments), including
            Baptism, Chrismation, the Eucharist, Confession, Marriage, Holy Orders, and
            Unction. Through these, God's grace is communicated to the faithful.

          <p class="text-charcoal text-sm">
            Orthodox worship is ancient, beautiful, and deeply scriptural. The Divine
            Liturgy, largely unchanged since the early Church, engages all the senses
            in the worship of God through icons, incense, chanting, and sacred gesture.

        <p class="text-charcoal mb-4">
          All Saints of Lincolnshire belongs to the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese.
          Antioch (in modern-day Turkey) was where the followers of Christ were first
          called "Christians" (Acts 11:26). The Antiochian tradition is known for its
          missionary spirit and its use of the vernacular language in worship.
