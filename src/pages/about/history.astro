        <p class="text-charcoal mb-6">
          All Saints of Lincolnshire grew as a mission from Louth parish. By 2005 it had
          grown to a point where it needed to meet weekly, and Fr. Philip moved from Louth
          to Lincoln to serve the growing community.
        </p>

        <p class="text-charcoal mb-6">
          Since the start, we have always had catechumens—most of whom have never attended
          a church before. This focus on welcoming newcomers to the faith remains central
          to our parish identity today.
        </p>

        <p class="text-charcoal mb-8">
          The parish has produced a priest and a deacon, with others currently preparing
          for ministry through Axios meetings.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl text-navy mb-6 mt-12">Our Building</h2>

        <p class="text-charcoal mb-6">
          The Temple was built in 1881 for the local barracks and passed out of use for
          them many decades ago. More recently it served as a centre for Deaf Chaplaincy
          in Lincolnshire.
        </p>

        <p class="text-charcoal mb-6">
          The building was modified over time to provide offices, kitchens, toilets,
          meeting rooms, halls, a car park, and a "worship centre." As our congregation
          has grown, the worship centre has expanded from a small part of the building
          to occupy most of it.

        <p class="text-charcoal mb-6">
          Today, All Saints continues to grow as a community devoted to mission and
          evangelism. We offer regular services throughout the week, catechumen classes,
          Bible studies, and various outreach ministries serving Lincoln and beyond.
