          All Saints of Lincolnshire exists to share the fullness of the Orthodox Christian
          faith with all who seek it. We are a missionary parish, focused on welcoming those
          who have never experienced the ancient Church.
        </p>
        <p class="text-charcoal mb-4">
          Most of our catechumens come to us with little or no church background. We meet
          them where they are, offering patient instruction, warm fellowship, and the
          transforming beauty of Orthodox worship.
